## ABSTRACT
Mobility on Indian roads has been on the rise in the last few decades and will continue to increase further. This has caused some serious issues like traffic congestion on narrow road stretches and unsafe roads and driving conditions. The frequency of accidents caused due to crashes increases due to traffic congestion. It also leads to road rage. Therefore, controlling traffic on roads, highways and especially on narrow and busy streets is the need of the hour. Apart from the increasing motor vehicles, non-motorized transport and e-Rickshaw is also an integral element of urban transport in Indian cities. More than 50% of the city residents cannot afford any other mode of transport unless heavily subsidized. This leads to suboptimal conditions for all modes of transport. The behavior and state of mind of drivers while on road has a major impact on the condition of the road as well. Planning for an optimal controlling system and integrating it with the other modes of city transport is a prerequisite for creating sustainable transport systems, thus leading to sustainable cities.
