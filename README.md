## ABSTRACT
Mobility on Indian roads has been on the rise in the last few decades and will continue to increase further. This has caused some serious issues like traffic congestion on narrow road stretches and unsafe roads and driving conditions. The frequency of accidents caused due to crashes increases due to traffic congestion. It also leads to road rage. Therefore, controlling traffic on roads, highways and especially on narrow and busy streets is the need of the hour. Apart from the increasing motor vehicles, non-motorized transport and e-Rickshaw is also an integral element of urban transport in Indian cities. More than 50% of the city residents cannot afford any other mode of transport unless heavily subsidized. This leads to suboptimal conditions for all modes of transport. The behavior and state of mind of drivers while on road has a major impact on the condition of the road as well. Planning for an optimal controlling system and integrating it with the other modes of city transport is a prerequisite for creating sustainable transport systems, thus leading to sustainable cities.

## INTRODUCTION AND MOTIVATION
Delhi is the Capital city of our country and one of the most populated cities of the world. With increasing population the no. of motor vehicles is also increasing rapidly. Despite being the NCT, the traffic control system is not up-to speed. Out of approximately 60 traffic circles (regions of traffic policing) of the state, there’s hardly any where there is no traffic congestion.

In this trek we aim to find out the root cause of the problems faced by the city in regard to smooth traffic flow. It came to our attention that most of the issues were:
1.	**Roadside encroachment** by e-Rickshaw, TSR, gramin seva vehicles and street vendors who take up most of the road and leave no space for other vehicles to pass. Also roadside parking which renders the roads blocked and cause congestion.
2.	**Slow moving vehicles in fast lane**, public transport vehicles, commercial goods vehicles block potential fast movers, e.g. motor-bikers, private cars etc. which causes road rage and accidents.
3.	**Traffic signal offenders**, drivers who rather than stopping at yellow lights, accelerate so they don’t have to wait for the signal to turn back green, thereby risking the life of others along with their own.

Observing these situations in the National Capital Territory itself, we decided to pay a visit to the Delhi Traffic Police Headquarters to find out more about the situation from the people who have one-on-one experience of dealing with these situations.

## SOCIO-ECONOMIC BACKGROUND
According to the Economic Survey of Delhi, 2015 “The total number of motor vehicles on road in NCT of Delhi as on 31st March, 2015 was 88.27 lakh, showing an increase of 6.4 per cent over previous year. The category wise number of motor vehicles in Delhi is presented in Statement 12.1”

  “The annual growth of vehicles in Delhi increased from 4.72 per cent in 1999-2000 to 6.89 per cent in 2014-15. During the same period the number of vehicles per thousand population increased considerably; from 253 to 487.”

## EXPERIENCES OF THE INTERACTION



## PROBLEMS IDENTIFIED
The problems we found due to the means of our trek are as follows:
1.	**Sensitisation towards road safety**: The drivers in the state are not very sensitive towards rules of road safety and risk the precious life of themselves and others while in transit.
2.	**Traffic control**: The current traffic signals are not very well equipped to handle the irregular traffic patterns of the city. In the conventional traffic lights after every preset timeout the light switches back to red. 
3.	**Ineffective enforcement**: The rules are enforced by either policemen appointed on the signals/on the road or by INTERCEPTOR vans which are not very effective as the cops cannot be available at every signal or every stretch. Problems with the current Interceptor Vans are
    1.	extremely poor resolution of camera.
    2.	inability to intercept fast-moving vehicles.
    3.	reflection from sunlight blinds the camera.
    4.	reflection from headlights during night time.
    5.	even during daytime, on seeing an interceptor van, drivers turn high-beam which blinds the camera.
4.	**Unplanned construction**: The design of roads, highways and even the metro lines is not well suited and not very well planned. There are lots of intersections where two traffic lanes merge and form bottlenecks causing congestion

## CONCLUSION
Following are the needs per this reoprt:
1. **A need of educating and sensitizing the drivers towards the risks of traffic rule violations**.
2. **A system which can**
    1. **intercept the traffic and control the signals accordingly**.
    2. **keeps 24x7 surveillance for traffic offenders and issues automated challans**.
